## What is TVC?

#Traffic Video Captioning Dataset (TVC-dataset)
	The existing datasets for video captioning contain videos with a variety of scenarios, and are not for ADAS traffic scenarios. For the video understanding and captioning problem, we build a dataset for ADAS traffic scenarios, called Traffic Video Captioning (TVC) dataset. The TVC dataset contains 2,000 traffic videos captured with on-board cameras. With various driving events, the TVC dataset is the first public dataset for video understanding and captioning problems.
	
	The TVC dataset has video-clips from our captured videos with an ADAS camera and many traffic videos from other public datasets including $D^2-City$ \cite{didi}, $DADA-2000$ \cite{dada} and $Road Hazard$ \cite{rapid}. The $D^2-City$ dataset is a comprehensive collection of dashcam videos collected by vehicles on DiDi platform in five Chinese cities; all videos are 30-second clips in 720p or 1080p resolution at a frame rate of 25fps. $DADA-2000$ dataset is built for predicting driver attention in driving accident scenarios with diverse weather conditions, light conditions, and occasions, etc. $Road Hazard$ dataset is a dataset for road hazard stimuli to assess how quickly participants in the laboratory can detect and correctly respond to briefly presented hazards.
